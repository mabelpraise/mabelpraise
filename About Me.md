- 👋 Hi, My name is Mabel Okeke, @mabelpraise.
- I am a skilled UI/UX designer focused on creating easy to use, aesthetically pleasing and great designs that offer amazing and exciting digital experiences to humans and brands across the world. My passion is to be part of teams that build timeless and outstanding digital products. 

I started my journey in tech as a Graphics Designer where I had the privilege of creating amazing brand assets ranging from identity designs to brand guides, presentation templates, design decks, brochures, marketing and social media designs etc. 

I later moved into Motion Design where I also deployed my video editing and animation skills to help brands and businesses scale in the digital space.

Then UI/UX Design. Becoming a UI/UX Designer has helped me improve my overall design skills, human relationship skills, design thinking skills and problem-solving skills.

Becoming a User Interface and Experience designer has played a huge role in me becoming better at what I do every day. I get to discover new and possible ways of creating better experiences for humans in the digital space and at the same time helping brands generate revenues and achieve their business goals.

I have over 5+ years of combined design experience spanning user interface and experience design, user research, interaction design, motion design, graphics design, branding and website design working with organizations and freelancing. My work experience cuts across industries like fintech, blockchain, real estate,  e-commerce and edutech.
